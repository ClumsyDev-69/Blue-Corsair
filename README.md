# Blue-Corsair
A simple game to chip away at spare time... At the start, everything feels impossible, esecially the later levels, but everything is possible.  Be assured, there is a way to complete the game. (Take a look at the cheat sheet to make life easy!)

How to Launch Application: Double-Click on the Blue Corsair.exe file present in this folder. This game is made for windows only, and needs to be opened through the .jar file for cross-platform working. YOU NEED A JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT TO RUN THIS FILE. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE IT, AN ERROR WILL BE SHOWN, AND YOU WILL BE DIRECTED TO THE JAVA DOWNLOAD PAGE.
To run the program without a JRE, download this repository from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pIOGhuePG-OR89j9TWD3c2amCvnj-6yt?usp=sharing

Other notes: Source files with the code can be found in the subfolders inside the src folder. To properly read the source code, an IDE may be required. While downloading from the drive link, multiple warnings may be given as a file from the wider internet is being downloaded. This is just a simple GUI program and doesnt have any risks associated.
